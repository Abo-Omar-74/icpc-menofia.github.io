# Our Community

Welcome to the officat site of the **ICPC Menofia Community**!  

## About us
We are a student-led group from **Menofia University** focused on **competitive programming** and **algorithmic problem-solving**. Our mission is to help students develop their skills, prepare for contests like **ICPC**, and connect with others who share a passion for coding and continuous learning.

Since our founding, we've been committed to:

- Supporting students as they begin their journey in competitive programming.  
- Organizing training sessions, workshops, and local contests to strengthen problem-solving skills.  
- Actively participating in regional and global competitions such as ICPC.  
- Fostering a collaborative learning environment through our Discord community and peer mentoring.
